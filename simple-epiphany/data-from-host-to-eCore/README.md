This example uses local eCores' memory to send data to single eCores.

to run :
`./build.sh && ./main.elf`

expected outcome :

```
Result from core n°00 is 0x0000
Result from core n°01 is 0x0001
Result from core n°02 is 0x0002
Result from core n°03 is 0x0000
Result from core n°04 is 0x0000
Result from core n°05 is 0x0000
Result from core n°06 is 0x0000
Result from core n°07 is 0x0000
Result from core n°08 is 0x0000
Result from core n°09 is 0x0000
Result from core n°10 is 0x0000
Result from core n°11 is 0x0000
Result from core n°12 is 0x0000
Result from core n°13 is 0x0000
Result from core n°14 is 0x0000
Result from core n°15 is 0x0000
```

In that outcome, we activated eCore 1 and 2.
